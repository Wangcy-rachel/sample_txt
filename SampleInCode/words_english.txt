"1","  Persistent inflammation driven by cytokines such as type-one interferon (IFN-I)        can cause immunosuppression. We show that administration of the Janus kinase 1        (JAK1) inhibitor itacitinib after anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1)        immunotherapy improves immune function and antitumor responses in mice and        results in high response rates (67%) in a phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic        non-small cell lung cancer. Patients who failed to respond to initial anti-PD-1        immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of        poor immune function to anti-PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition.        Itacitinib promoted CD8 T cell plasticity and therapeutic responses of exhausted        and effector memory-like T cell clonotypes. Patients with persistent inflammation        refractory to itacitinib showed progressive CD8 T cell terminal differentiation        and progressive disease. Thus, JAK inhibition may improve the efficacy of        anti-PD-1 immunotherapy by pivoting T cell differentiation dynamics.  Although immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 blockade is routine for lung cancer, little        is known about acquired resistance. Among 1,201 patients with non-small cell lung        cancer (NSCLC) treated with PD-(L)1 blockade, acquired resistance is common,        occurring in >60% of initial responders. Acquired resistance shows differential        expression of inflammation and interferon (IFN) signaling. Relapsed tumors can be        separated by upregulated or stable expression of IFNγ response genes.        Upregulation of IFNγ response genes is associated with putative routes of        resistance characterized by signatures of persistent IFN signaling, immune        dysfunction, and mutations in antigen presentation genes which can be        recapitulated in multiple murine models of acquired resistance to PD-(L)1        blockade after in vitro IFNγ treatment. Acquired resistance to PD-(L)1 blockade        in NSCLC is associated with an ongoing, but altered IFN response. The        persistently inflamed, rather than excluded or deserted, tumor microenvironment        of acquired resistance may inform therapeutic strategies to effectively reprogram        and reverse acquired resistance.  Despite the successful application of immune checkpoint therapy, no response or        recurrence is typical in lung cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been        identified as a crucial player in immunotherapy-related resistance. Ferroptosis,        a form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, is highly        regulated by cellular metabolism remolding and has been shown to have synergistic        effects when combined with immunotherapy. Metabolic adaption of CSCs drives tumor        resistance, yet the mechanisms of their ferroptosis defense in tumor immune        evasion remain elusive. Here, through metabolomics, transcriptomics, a lung        epithelial-specific Cpt1a-knockout mouse model, and clinical analysis, we        demonstrate that CPT1A, a key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, acts        with L-carnitine, derived from tumor-associated macrophages to drive        ferroptosis-resistance and CD8(+) T cells inactivation in lung cancer.        Mechanistically, CPT1A restrains ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc, while        c-Myc transcriptionally activates CPT1A expression. The CPT1A/c-Myc positive        feedback loop further enhances the cellular antioxidant capacity by activating        the NRF2/GPX4 system and reduces the amount of phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty        acids through ACSL4 downregulating, thereby suppressing ferroptosis in CSCs.        Significantly, targeting CPT1A enhances immune checkpoint blockade-induced        anti-tumor immunity and tumoral ferroptosis in tumor-bearing mice. The results        illustrate the potential of a mechanism-guided therapeutic strategy by targeting        a metabolic vulnerability in the ferroptosis of CSCs to improve the efficacy of        lung cancer immunotherapy.  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive neuroendocrine carcinoma        that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of effective treatments.        Advances in DNA sequencing and whole transcriptomics have delineated key        subtypes; therefore, SCLC is no longer viewed as a homogeneous cancer.        Chemoimmunotherapy with PD1 blockade is now the standard of care for advanced        disease, and ongoing research efforts are moving this strategy into the limited        stage setting. Combination strategies of immunotherapy with radiation are also        under active clinical trial in both limited and extensive stage disease. PLAIN        LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive        neuroendocrine carcinoma that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of        effective treatments. Chemoimmunotherapy with immune check point inhibitors is        now the standard of care for advanced disease. This comprehensive review provides        an overview of current treatment strategies for SCLC, unmet needs in this patient        population, and emerging treatment strategies incorporating immunotherapy that        will hopefully further improve outcomes for patients.  IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus chemotherapy combination        treatment (ICI-chemotherapy) is now a standard treatment for non-small cell lung        cancer (NSCLC) without targetable oncogene alterations, but there are few data on        ICI-chemotherapy for patients 75 years and older. OBJECTIVE: To inform the choice        of first-line drugs in clinical practice and assess the safety and efficacy of        ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment in older adult patients with previously        untreated advanced NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective        cohort study included 58 centers in Japan. The cohort consisted of patients 75        years and older with clinical stage IIIB, IIIC, IV, postoperative or radiotherapy        recurrent NSCLC. Patients started first-line systemic therapy between December        2018 and March 2021. Those receiving first-line molecular targeted drugs were        excluded. The data were analyzed from February 2022 to October 2022. EXPOSURES:        Systemic therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were overall        survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of        1245 patients (median [range] age, 78 [75-95] years; 967 [78%] male) with NSCLC        were included in the cohort. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression of less        than 1% occurred in 268 tumors (22%); 1% to 49% in 387 tumors (31%); 50% and        higher in 410 tumors (33%), and unknown expression in 180 tumors (14%). Median OS        was 20.0 (95% CI, 17.1-23.6) months for the 354 patients receiving        ICI-chemotherapy (28%); 19.8 (95% CI, 16.5-23.8) months for the 425 patients        receiving ICI alone (34%); 12.8 (95% CI, 10.7-15.6) months for the 311 patients        receiving platinum-doublet chemotherapy (25%); and 9.5 (95% CI, 7.4-13.4) months        for the 155 patients receiving single-agent chemotherapy (12%). After propensity        score matching, no differences in OS and PFS were found between the patients        receiving ICI-chemotherapy vs ICI alone. Each group consisted of 118 patients.        For PD-L1 expression of 1% and higher the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.98 (95% CI,        0.67-1.42; P = .90), and the PFS HR was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-1.25; P = .59).        Significance was also not reached when separately analyzed for lower or higher        PD-L1 expression (1%-49% or ≥50%). However, grade 3 or higher immune-related        adverse events occurred in 86 patients (24.3%) treated with ICI-chemotherapy and        76 (17.9%) with ICI alone (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study,        ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment did not improve survival and increased the        incidence of grade 3 and higher immune-related adverse events compared with ICI        alone in patients 75 years and older. Based on these results, ICI alone may be        recommended for older adult patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC.  Engineered cytokine-based approaches for immunotherapy of cancer are poised to        enter the clinic, with IL-12 being at the forefront. However, little is known        about potential mechanisms of resistance to cytokine therapies. We found that        orthotopic murine lung tumors were resistant to systemically delivered IL-12        fused to murine serum albumin (MSA, IL12-MSA) because of low IL-12 receptor        (IL-12R) expression on tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. IL2-MSA increased binding of        IL12-MSA by tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells, and combined administration of IL12-MSA        and IL2-MSA led to enhanced tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell effector differentiation,        decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ regulatory T cells, and increased        survival of lung tumor-bearing mice. Predictably, the combination of IL-2 and        IL-12 at therapeutic doses led to significant dose-limiting toxicity.        Administering IL-12 and IL-2 analogs with preferential binding to cells        expressing Il12rb1 and CD25, respectively, led to a significant extension of        survival in mice with lung tumors while abrogating dose-limiting toxicity. These        findings suggest that IL-12 and IL-2 represent a rational approach to combination        cytokine therapy whose dose-limiting toxicity can be overcome with engineered        cytokine variants.  Pro-tumoral macrophages in lung tumors present a significant challenge in        immunotherapy. Here, we introduce a pH-responsive nanomedicine approach for        activating anti-tumoral macrophages and dendritic cells. Using a layered double        hydroxide nanosheet carrier, we co-deliver a T-type calcium channel inhibitor        (TTA-Q6) and a CD47 inhibitor (RRX-001) into lung tumors. In the tumor acidic        environment, TTA-Q6 is released, disrupting cancer cell calcium uptake, causing        endoplasmic reticulum stress and inducing calreticulin transfer to the cell        surface. Surface calreticulin activates macrophages and triggers dendritic cell        maturation, promoting effective antigen presentation and therefore activating        antitumor T cells. Simultaneously, RRX-001 reduces CD47 protein levels, aiding in        preventing immune escape by calreticulin-rich cancer cells. In lung tumor models        in male mice, this combined approach shows anti-tumor effects and immunity        against tumor re-exposure, highlighting its potential for lung cancer        immunotherapy.  DLL3 acts as an inhibitory ligand that downregulates Notch signaling and is        upregulated by ASCL1, a transcription factor prevalent in the small-cell lung        cancer (SCLC) subtype SCLC-A. Currently, the therapeutic strategies targeting        DLL3 are varied, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific T-cell        engagers (BiTEs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. Although        rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) showed promise in a phase II study, it failed to        produce favorable results in subsequent phase III trials, leading to the        cessation of its development. Conversely, DLL3-targeted BiTEs have garnered        significant clinical interest. Tarlatamab, for instance, demonstrated enhanced        response rates and progression-free survival compared to the standard of care in        a phase II trial; its biologics license application (BLA) is currently under US        Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Numerous ongoing phase III studies aim        to further evaluate tarlatamab's clinical efficacy, alongside the development of        novel DLL3-targeted T-cell engagers, both bispecific and trispecific. CAR-T cell        therapies targeting DLL3 have recently emerged and are undergoing various        preclinical and early-phase clinical studies. Additionally, preclinical studies        have shown promising efficacy for DLL3-targeted radiotherapy, which employs        β-particle-emitting therapeutic radioisotopes conjugated to DLL3-targeting        antibodies. DLL3-targeted therapies hold substantial potential for SCLC        management. Future clinical trials will be crucial for comparing treatment        outcomes among various approaches and exploring combination therapies to improve        patient survival outcomes.  BACKGROUND: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive option for patients with        medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can trigger abscopal        immune-regulatory effects. However, it remains unclear how cryoablation affects        the host-level immune response in NSCLC. In this study, we investigated the local        and systemic immunological effects of cryoablation and the potential of combining        cryoablation with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade to boost        immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: We first investigated systemic        immunological effects induced by cryoablation in patients with early-stage NSCLC.        Subsequently, we explored cryoablation-induced antitumor immunity and the        underlying biological mechanisms using KP (Kras (G12D/+), Tp53 (-/-)) mutant lung        cancer cell allograft mouse models. Moreover, the synergistic efficacy of        cryoablation and PD-1 blockade was explored in both mouse models and patients        with unresectable NSCLC. RESULTS: We found that cryoablation significantly        increased circulating CD8(+) T cell subpopulations and proinflammatory cytokines        in patients with early-stage NSCLC. In lung cancer cell allograft mouse models,        we demonstrated that cryoablation resulted in abscopal growth inhibition of        contralateral, non-ablated tumors. Integrated analysis of bulk, single-cell RNA        and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data revealed that cryoablation reprogrammed        the intratumoral immune microenvironment and increased CD8(+) T cell infiltration        with higher effector signature, interferon (IFN) response, and cytolytic        activity. Mechanistically, cryoablation promoted antitumor effect through the        STING-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, and type I IFN signaling blockade        attenuated this antitumor effect. We also found that the combination of PD-1        blockade with cryoablation further inhibited tumor growth compared with either        treatment alone in an allograft mouse model. Moreover, the combination therapy        induced notable tumor suppression and CD8(+) T cell infiltration in patients with        unresectable NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide mechanistic insights into        how cryoablation triggers the antitumor immune effect in lung cancer, thereby        potentiating programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 blockade efficacy in the        clinical treatment of NSCLC.  Brain metastases (BMs) are the most common form of intracranial malignant        neoplasms in adults, with a profound impact on quality of life and traditionally        associated with a dismal prognosis. Lung cancer accounts for approximately        40%-50% of BM across different tumors. The process leading to BMs is complex and        includes local invasion, intravasation, tumor cells circulation into the        bloodstream, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, extravasation of tumor cells        into the brain parenchyma, and interaction with cells of the brain        microenvironment, among others. Once the tumor cells have seeded in the brain        parenchyma, they encounter different glial cells of the brain, as well as immune        cells. The interaction between these cells and tumor cells is complex and is        associated with both antitumoral and protumoral effects. To overcome the lethal        prognosis associated with BMs, different treatment strategies have been        developed, such as immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly        inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which have demonstrated to be an effective        treatment in both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. These        antibodies have shown to be effective in the treatment of BM, alone or in        combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, many unsolved questions        remain to be answered, such as the sequencing of immunotherapy and radiotherapy,        the optimal management in symptomatic BMs, the role of the addition of        anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, and so forth. The complexity in the management of BMs in        the era of immunotherapy requires a multidisciplinary approach to adequately        treat this devastating event. The aim of this review is to summarize evidence        regarding epidemiology of BM, its pathophysiology, current approach to treatment        strategies, as well as future perspectives.  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the highly aggressive malignancies        characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis, but treatment options are        limited. For SCLC, carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with etoposide        chemotherapy has been considered the only standard of care, but the standard        first-line treatment only results in 10-month survival. The majority of patients        relapse within a few weeks to months after treatment, despite the relatively        sensitive response to chemotherapy. Over the past decade, immunotherapy has made        significant progress in the treatment of SCLC patients. However, there have been        limited improvements in survival rates for SCLC patients with the current immune        checkpoint inhibitors PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. In the face of high recurrence        rates, small beneficiary populations, and low survival benefits, the exploration        of new targets for key molecules and signals in SCLC and the development of drugs        with novel mechanisms may provide fresh hope for immunotherapy in SCLC.        Therefore, the aim of this review was to explore four new targets, DLL3, TIGIT,        LAG-3, and GD2, which may play a role in the immunotherapy of SCLC to find useful        clues and strategies to improve the outcome for SCLC patients.  The organization of immune cells in human tumors is not well understood.        Immunogenic tumors harbor spatially localized multicellular 'immunity hubs'        defined by expression of the T cell-attracting chemokines CXCL10/CXCL11 and        abundant T cells. Here, we examined immunity hubs in human pre-immunotherapy lung        cancer specimens and found an association with beneficial response to PD-1        blockade. Critically, we discovered the stem-immunity hub, a subtype of immunity        hub strongly associated with favorable PD-1-blockade outcome. This hub is        distinct from mature tertiary lymphoid structures and is enriched for stem-like        TCF7(+)PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells, activated CCR7(+)LAMP3(+) dendritic cells and        CCL19(+) fibroblasts as well as chemokines that organize these cells. Within the        stem-immunity hub, we find preferential interactions between CXCL10(+)        macrophages and TCF7(-)CD8(+) T cells as well as between mature regulatory        dendritic cells and TCF7(+)CD4(+) and regulatory T cells. These results provide a        picture of the spatial organization of the human intratumoral immune response and        its relevance to patient immunotherapy outcomes.  Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has significantly changed the therapeutic approach for        treating patients with surgically resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).        Here, peripheral blood inflammation-based biomarkers as well as previously less        focused eosinophil fraction, modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), and        prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were systematically included to        comprehensively analyze their potential in predicting neoadjuvant immunotherapy        efficacy and prognosis. We enrolled 189 patients (94 in training and 95 in        validation cohorts) with stage I-III B surgically resectable NSCLC treated with        neoadjuvant immunotherapy from the National Cancer Center of China. Baseline and        post-treatment eosinophils fraction, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),        platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII),        monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), PNI, mGPS, and their changes were calculated        and analyzed for correlation with neoadjuvant immunotherapy efficacy and        prognosis. In patients in the major pathological response (MPR) group, the        post-treatment eosinophil fraction was significantly high, and NLR, PLR, SII, and        MLR were significantly lower compared to the non-MPR group in both the training        and validation cohorts. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that        post-treatment, eosinophil fraction and SII and their changing were two of the        most important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses        showed that post-treatment eosinophil fraction, SII, mGPS, and ΔSII could        independently predict MPR in patients treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy.        Survival analysis showed a significant correlation between high post-treatment        NLR, PLR, SII, mGPS, and their changes in ΔNLR and ΔSII elevation with poor        overall survival and event-free survival of patients. Our results suggest that        inflammatory biomarkers could predict the patient's response to neoadjuvant        immunotherapy and prognosis.  Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which has a high rate of metastatic spread        and drug resistance, is the most common subtype of lung cancer. Therefore, NSCLC        patients have a very poor prognosis and a very low chance of survival. Human        cancers are closely linked to regulated cell death (RCD), such as apoptosis,        autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Currently, small-molecule        compounds targeting various types of RCD have shown potential as anticancer        treatments. Moreover, RCD appears to be a specific part of the antitumor immune        response; hence, the combination of RCD and immunotherapy might increase the        inhibitory effect of therapy on tumor growth. In this review, we summarize        small-molecule compounds used for the treatment of NSCLC by focusing on RCD and        pharmacological systems. In addition, we describe the current research status of        an immunotherapy combined with an RCD-based regimen for NSCLC, providing new        ideas for targeting RCD pathways in combination with immunotherapy for patients        with NSCLC in the future.  BACKGROUND: Despite surgical resection, long-term survival of patients with        resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor. Adjuvant        chemotherapy, the standard of care for locally advanced NSCLC, provides a        marginal 5.4% benefit in survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown        a significant survival benefit in some patients with advanced NSCLC and are being        evaluated for perioperative use in resectable NSCLC. METHODS: We conducted a        literature search using the PubMed online database to identify clinical trials of        immunotherapy in resectable NSCLC and studies analyzing biomarkers and immune        priming strategies. RESULTS: Building on previous phase I and II trials,        randomized phase III trials have shown efficacy of neoadjuvant nivolumab,        perioperative pembrolizumab, adjuvant atezolizumab, and adjuvant pembrolizumab in        the treatment of NSCLC with improvement of event-free/disease-free survival of        24% to 42%, leading to United States Food and Drug Administration approval of        these drugs in the treatment of resectable NSCLC. Three additional phase III        trials have also recently reported the use of immunotherapy both before and after        surgery, with pathologic complete response rates of 17% to 25%, significantly        better than chemotherapy alone. Perioperative ICI therapy has comparable        perioperative morbidity to chemotherapy alone and does not impair surgical        outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative immunotherapy, in combination with        chemotherapy, is safe and improves outcomes in patients with resectable NSCLC.        Questions regarding patient selection, the need for adjuvant ICI therapy after        neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, and the duration of perioperative immunotherapy        remain to be answered by future trials.  BACKGROUND: Lymph node (LN) dissection is a common procedure for non-small cell        lung cancer (NSCLC) to ascertain disease severity and treatment options. However,        murine studies have indicated that excising tumor-draining LNs diminished        immunotherapy effectiveness, though its applicability to clinical patients        remains uncertain. Hence, the authors aim to illustrate the immunological        implications of LN dissection by analyzing the impact of dissected LN (DLN) count        on immunotherapy efficacy, and to propose a novel 'immunotherapy-driven' LN        dissection strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective        analysis of NSCLC patients underwent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for recurrence        between 2018 and 2020, assessing outcomes based on DLN count stratification.        RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were included, of whom 59 had a DLN count less        than or equal to 16 (median, IQR: 11, 7-13); 66 had a DLN count greater than 16        (median, IQR: 23, 19-29). With a median follow-up time of 14.3 months (95% CI:        11.0-17.6), the overall median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 (95% CI:        4.1-11.7) months, 11.7 (95% CI: 7.9-15.6) months in the combination therapy        subgroup, and 4.8 (95% CI: 3.1-6.4) months in the immunotherapy alone subgroup,        respectively. In multivariable Cox analysis, DLN count less than or equal to 16        is associated with an improved PFS in all cohorts [primary cohort: HR=0.26 (95%        CI: 0.07-0.89), P =0.03]; [validation cohort: HR=0.46 (95% CI: 0.22-0.96), P        =0.04]; [entire cohort: HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.32-0.89), P =0.02]. The prognostic        benefit of DLN count less than or equal to 16 was more significant in        immunotherapy alone, no adjuvant treatment, pN1, female, and squamous carcinoma        subgroups. A higher level of CD8+ central memory T cell (Tcm) within LNs was        associated with improved PFS (HR: 0.235, 95% CI: 0.065-0.845, P =0.027).        CONCLUSIONS: An elevated DLN count (cutoff: 16) was associated with poorer        immunotherapy efficacy in recurrent NSCLC, especially pronounced in the        immunotherapy alone subgroup. CD8+Tcm proportions in LNs may also impact        immunotherapy efficacy. Therefore, for patients planned for adjuvant        immunotherapy, a precise rather than expanded lymphadenectomy strategy to        preserve immune-depending LNs is recommended.  PURPOSE: Although immunotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for advanced non-small        cell lung cancer (NSCLC), robust biomarkers of clinical response are lacking. The        heterogeneity of clinical responses together with the limited value of        radiographic response assessments to timely and accurately predict therapeutic        effect-especially in the setting of stable disease-calls for the development of        molecularly informed real-time minimally invasive approaches. In addition to        capturing tumor regression, liquid biopsies may be informative in capturing        immune-related adverse events (irAE). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated        longitudinal changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with metastatic        NSCLC who received immunotherapy-based regimens. Using ctDNA targeted        error-correction sequencing together with matched sequencing of white blood cells        and tumor tissue, we tracked serial changes in cell-free tumor load (cfTL) and        determined molecular response. Peripheral T-cell repertoire dynamics were        serially assessed and evaluated together with plasma protein expression profiles.        RESULTS: Molecular response, defined as complete clearance of cfTL, was        significantly associated with progression-free (log-rank P = 0.0003) and overall        survival (log-rank P = 0.01) and was particularly informative in capturing        differential survival outcomes among patients with radiographically stable        disease. For patients who developed irAEs, on-treatment peripheral blood T-cell        repertoire reshaping, assessed by significant T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypic        expansions and regressions, was identified on average 5 months prior to clinical        diagnosis of an irAE. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular responses assist with the        interpretation of heterogeneous clinical responses, especially for patients with        stable disease. Our complementary assessment of the peripheral tumor and immune        compartments provides an approach for monitoring of clinical benefits and irAEs        during immunotherapy.  IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint        inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy (ICI-chemotherapy) for patients with        early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have reported consistent        associations with event-free survival (EFS) and pathologic complete response        (pCR) pending longer follow-up for overall survival data. OBJECTIVE: To assess        the pooled benefit of ICI-chemotherapy in 2-year EFS and pCR among patients with        NSCLC and examine the impact of clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related        factors. DATA SOURCES: Full-text articles and abstracts in English were searched        in EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the        Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through November 1, 2023, and in oncology        conference proceedings from January 1, 2008, to November 1, 2023. STUDY        SELECTION: Phase 2 or 3 RCTs with neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy with or without        adjuvant ICIs vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone with or without placebo or        observation in patients with previously untreated NSCLC staged IB to IIIB were        included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction of prespecified data        elements was performed by 2 reviewers using a structured data abstraction        electronic form. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The        meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and        Meta-Analyses guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two-year EFS and pCR were        the outcomes of interest in patients who received neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy        (experimental arm) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm). Aggregated        pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes (2-year EFS) and risk        ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes (pCR) with their respective 95% CIs were        calculated. RESULTS: Eight trials with 3387 patients were included, with some        concerns of risk of bias as assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration method, mainly        related to outcomes measurements. Neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy was associated        with improved 2-year EFS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.66; P < .001) and increased        pCR rate (RR, 5.58; 95% CI, 4.27-7.29; P < .001) in the experimental vs control        treatment arms. This association was not significantly modified by the main        patient characteristics; tumor- or treatment-related factors, including tumor        programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status; type of platinum-compound        chemotherapy; number of cycles of neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy; or addition of        adjuvant ICIs. Patients whose tumor cells were negative for PD-L1 were at higher        risk of relapse (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91) than were those with low (HR, 0.61;        95% CI, 0.37-0.71) or high PD-L1 (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27-0.58) (P = .005).        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of        neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy RCTs in patients with early-stage NSCLC, 3 cycles of        neoadjuvant platinum-based ICI-chemotherapy were associated with a meaningful        improvement in 2-year EFS and pCR.  Immune checkpoint blockers have transformed non-small-cell lung cancer treatment,        but they can lead to autoimmune and inflammatory side effects, leading to the        concurrent use of immunosuppressive treatments. In this analysis, we delve into        the potential of antibodies checkpoint blockade, focusing on CTLA-4 inhibition        using ipilimumab, as a groundbreaking cancer immunotherapy. We also concentrate        on the role of biomarkers, particularly PD-L1 activity and mutation significance,        in predicting the response to programmed cell death protein 1 blockage and the        prevalence of side effects associated with immune-related side effects. In        describing the patterns of cancer response to immunotherapy, we underline the        limitations of response assessment criteria like RECIST and World Health        Organization. We also stress the necessity of ongoing studies and clinical        trials, standardized guidelines, and additional research to improve response        assessment in the era of immunotherapy.  Lung cancer (LC) and tuberculosis (TB) are two major global public health        problems, and the incidence of LC-TB is currently on the rise. Therefore        effective clinical interventions are crucial for LC-TB. The aim of this review is        to provide up-to-date information on the immunological profile and therapeutic        biomarkers in patients with LC-TB. We discuss the immune mechanisms involved,        including the immune checkpoints that play an important role in the treatment of        patients with LC-TB. In addition, we explore the susceptibility of patients with        LC to TB and summarise the latest research on LC-TB. Finally, we discuss future        prospects in this field, including the identification of potential targets for        immune intervention. In conclusion, this review provides important insights into        the complex relationship between LC and TB and highlights new advances in the        detection and treatment of both diseases.  Immune checkpoint inhibitors( ICI) became available in the field of non-small        cell lung cancer in 2015. Nine years have already passed since their use in        clinical practice, and ICI are now being developed for clinical application not        only in un-resectable advanced stage lung cancer but also in peri-operative        treatment. In this report, we review the history of immunotherapy and summarize        the current status of clinical development of ICI in advanced lung cancer and its        use as peri-operative treatment. The biomarkers analysis and management of        immune-related adverse events, which are important in the treatment of ICI, will        also be discussed in this review.  OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of        neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).        METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in treating        patients with NSCLC were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases,        eligible studies, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, guidelines, and        conference abstracts. The meta-analysis was performed by the Stata/SE 12.0        software. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were eventually included.        The results of the meta-analysis showed that neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy        significantly improved the objective response rate compared with neoadjuvant        chemotherapy (CT; 62.46% vs 41.88%, P = 0.003), but the objective response rate        of neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy was roughly comparable to that of neoadjuvant        single-immunotherapy (15.74% vs 10.45%, P = 0.387). Major pathologic response        (MPR) rate and pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant        immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy were significantly        superior to neoadjuvant CT alone and neoadjuvant single-immunotherapy,        respectively. Compared with neoadjuvant CT alone, neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy        increased the down-staging rate (40.16% vs 26.70%, P = 0.060), the surgical        resection rate (83.69% vs 73.07%, P = 0.231), and R0 resection rate (86.19% vs        77.98%, P = 0.502), but there were no statistically significant differences.        Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy did not increase the postoperative complications        rate than neoadjuvant CT alone (40.20% vs 41.30%, P = 0.920). In terms of safety,        neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy did not        increase the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and the grade        3 or higher TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy had        better clinical efficacy than neoadjuvant CT for patients with NSCLC. MPR rate        and pCR rate of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant        double-immunotherapy were significantly superior to neoadjuvant CT and        neoadjuvant single-immunotherapy, respectively, for patients with NSCLC, showing        that MPR rate and pCR rate were probably considered as alternative endpoints for        survival benefit. TRAEs were comparable between the corresponding groups. The        long-term survival outcome of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC        needs to be further confirmed to better guide clinical practice.  INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy (IO) has established a new milestone in lung cancer        treatment. Several registrational studies have approved immune checkpoint        inhibitors (ICIs) in different settings, including the metastatic nonsmall cell        lung cancer (NSCLC). As well known, responders are just a certain proportion of        patients; therefore, their selection by using predictive factors has stood out as        a crucial issue to address in tailoring a patient-centered care. AREAS COVERED:        In our review we propose a detailed yet handy cross section on ICIs as first-line        treatment in metastatic NSCLC, regarding indications, histological, clinical, and        blood-based biomarkers, other than their mechanisms of resistance and new        immunological actionable targets. We performed a literature search through PubMed        entering keywords complying with crucial features of immunotherapy. EXPERT        OPINION: IO represents the backbone of lung cancer treatment. Trials are        currently testing novel immune blockade agents assessing combinatorial approaches        with standard ICIs, or antibody drug conjugates (ADC), harboring immunological        targets. Perfecting patients' selection is an ongoing challenge and a more and        more urgent need in order to best predict responders who will consistently        benefit from it.  The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) -based immunotherapies for cancer is highly        dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable        lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies        is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk        of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further        complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the        potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high-throughput        combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently        deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3,        demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung        cancer cells over ALC-0315, the industry-standard LNPs, while providing potent        immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with        circRNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12), induces a robust immune response in a        Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological        profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45(+) leukocytes        and enhances infiltration of CD8(+) T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3        LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight        the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer        therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics."
