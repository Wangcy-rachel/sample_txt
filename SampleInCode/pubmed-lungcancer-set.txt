AB  - Persistent inflammation driven by cytokines such as type-one interferon (IFN-I) 
      can cause immunosuppression. We show that administration of the Janus kinase 1 
      (JAK1) inhibitor itacitinib after anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) 
      immunotherapy improves immune function and antitumor responses in mice and 
      results in high response rates (67%) in a phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic 
      non-small cell lung cancer. Patients who failed to respond to initial anti-PD-1 
      immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of 
      poor immune function to anti-PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition. 
      Itacitinib promoted CD8 T cell plasticity and therapeutic responses of exhausted 
      and effector memory-like T cell clonotypes. Patients with persistent inflammation 
      refractory to itacitinib showed progressive CD8 T cell terminal differentiation 
      and progressive disease. Thus, JAK inhibition may improve the efficacy of 
      anti-PD-1 immunotherapy by pivoting T cell differentiation dynamics.

AB  - Although immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 blockade is routine for lung cancer, little 
      is known about acquired resistance. Among 1,201 patients with non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with PD-(L)1 blockade, acquired resistance is common, 
      occurring in >60% of initial responders. Acquired resistance shows differential 
      expression of inflammation and interferon (IFN) signaling. Relapsed tumors can be 
      separated by upregulated or stable expression of IFNγ response genes. 
      Upregulation of IFNγ response genes is associated with putative routes of 
      resistance characterized by signatures of persistent IFN signaling, immune 
      dysfunction, and mutations in antigen presentation genes which can be 
      recapitulated in multiple murine models of acquired resistance to PD-(L)1 
      blockade after in vitro IFNγ treatment. Acquired resistance to PD-(L)1 blockade 
      in NSCLC is associated with an ongoing, but altered IFN response. The 
      persistently inflamed, rather than excluded or deserted, tumor microenvironment 
      of acquired resistance may inform therapeutic strategies to effectively reprogram 
      and reverse acquired resistance.

      synergizes with immunotherapy in lung cancer.

AB  - Despite the successful application of immune checkpoint therapy, no response or 
      recurrence is typical in lung cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been 
      identified as a crucial player in immunotherapy-related resistance. Ferroptosis, 
      a form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, is highly 
      regulated by cellular metabolism remolding and has been shown to have synergistic 
      effects when combined with immunotherapy. Metabolic adaption of CSCs drives tumor 
      resistance, yet the mechanisms of their ferroptosis defense in tumor immune 
      evasion remain elusive. Here, through metabolomics, transcriptomics, a lung 
      epithelial-specific Cpt1a-knockout mouse model, and clinical analysis, we 
      demonstrate that CPT1A, a key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, acts 
      with L-carnitine, derived from tumor-associated macrophages to drive 
      ferroptosis-resistance and CD8(+) T cells inactivation in lung cancer. 
      Mechanistically, CPT1A restrains ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc, while 
      c-Myc transcriptionally activates CPT1A expression. The CPT1A/c-Myc positive 
      feedback loop further enhances the cellular antioxidant capacity by activating 
      the NRF2/GPX4 system and reduces the amount of phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids through ACSL4 downregulating, thereby suppressing ferroptosis in CSCs. 
      Significantly, targeting CPT1A enhances immune checkpoint blockade-induced 
      anti-tumor immunity and tumoral ferroptosis in tumor-bearing mice. The results 
      illustrate the potential of a mechanism-guided therapeutic strategy by targeting 
      a metabolic vulnerability in the ferroptosis of CSCs to improve the efficacy of 
      lung cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive neuroendocrine carcinoma 
      that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of effective treatments. 
      Advances in DNA sequencing and whole transcriptomics have delineated key 
      subtypes; therefore, SCLC is no longer viewed as a homogeneous cancer. 
      Chemoimmunotherapy with PD1 blockade is now the standard of care for advanced 
      disease, and ongoing research efforts are moving this strategy into the limited 
      stage setting. Combination strategies of immunotherapy with radiation are also 
      under active clinical trial in both limited and extensive stage disease. PLAIN 
      LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive 
      neuroendocrine carcinoma that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of 
      effective treatments. Chemoimmunotherapy with immune check point inhibitors is 
      now the standard of care for advanced disease. This comprehensive review provides 
      an overview of current treatment strategies for SCLC, unmet needs in this patient 
      population, and emerging treatment strategies incorporating immunotherapy that 
      will hopefully further improve outcomes for patients.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus chemotherapy combination 
      treatment (ICI-chemotherapy) is now a standard treatment for non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) without targetable oncogene alterations, but there are few data on 
      ICI-chemotherapy for patients 75 years and older. OBJECTIVE: To inform the choice 
      of first-line drugs in clinical practice and assess the safety and efficacy of 
      ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment in older adult patients with previously 
      untreated advanced NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective 
      cohort study included 58 centers in Japan. The cohort consisted of patients 75 
      years and older with clinical stage IIIB, IIIC, IV, postoperative or radiotherapy 
      recurrent NSCLC. Patients started first-line systemic therapy between December 
      2018 and March 2021. Those receiving first-line molecular targeted drugs were 
      excluded. The data were analyzed from February 2022 to October 2022. EXPOSURES: 
      Systemic therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were overall 
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: A total of 
      1245 patients (median [range] age, 78 [75-95] years; 967 [78%] male) with NSCLC 
      were included in the cohort. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression of less 
      than 1% occurred in 268 tumors (22%); 1% to 49% in 387 tumors (31%); 50% and 
      higher in 410 tumors (33%), and unknown expression in 180 tumors (14%). Median OS 
      was 20.0 (95% CI, 17.1-23.6) months for the 354 patients receiving 
      ICI-chemotherapy (28%); 19.8 (95% CI, 16.5-23.8) months for the 425 patients 
      receiving ICI alone (34%); 12.8 (95% CI, 10.7-15.6) months for the 311 patients 
      receiving platinum-doublet chemotherapy (25%); and 9.5 (95% CI, 7.4-13.4) months 
      for the 155 patients receiving single-agent chemotherapy (12%). After propensity 
      score matching, no differences in OS and PFS were found between the patients 
      receiving ICI-chemotherapy vs ICI alone. Each group consisted of 118 patients. 
      For PD-L1 expression of 1% and higher the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.98 (95% CI, 
      0.67-1.42; P = .90), and the PFS HR was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-1.25; P = .59). 
      Significance was also not reached when separately analyzed for lower or higher 
      PD-L1 expression (1%-49% or ≥50%). However, grade 3 or higher immune-related 
      adverse events occurred in 86 patients (24.3%) treated with ICI-chemotherapy and 
      76 (17.9%) with ICI alone (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 
      ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment did not improve survival and increased the 
      incidence of grade 3 and higher immune-related adverse events compared with ICI 
      alone in patients 75 years and older. Based on these results, ICI alone may be 
      recommended for older adult patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC.

TI  - Overcoming lung cancer immunotherapy resistance by combining nontoxic variants of 
      IL-12 and IL-2.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.172728 [doi]
LID - e172728
AB  - Engineered cytokine-based approaches for immunotherapy of cancer are poised to 
      enter the clinic, with IL-12 being at the forefront. However, little is known 
      about potential mechanisms of resistance to cytokine therapies. We found that 
      orthotopic murine lung tumors were resistant to systemically delivered IL-12 
      fused to murine serum albumin (MSA, IL12-MSA) because of low IL-12 receptor 
      (IL-12R) expression on tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. IL2-MSA increased binding of 
      IL12-MSA by tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells, and combined administration of IL12-MSA 
      and IL2-MSA led to enhanced tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell effector differentiation, 
      decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ regulatory T cells, and increased 
      survival of lung tumor-bearing mice. Predictably, the combination of IL-2 and 
      IL-12 at therapeutic doses led to significant dose-limiting toxicity. 
      Administering IL-12 and IL-2 analogs with preferential binding to cells 
      expressing Il12rb1 and CD25, respectively, led to a significant extension of 
      survival in mice with lung tumors while abrogating dose-limiting toxicity. These 
      findings suggest that IL-12 and IL-2 represent a rational approach to combination 
      cytokine therapy whose dose-limiting toxicity can be overcome with engineered 
      cytokine variants.

AB  - Pro-tumoral macrophages in lung tumors present a significant challenge in 
      immunotherapy. Here, we introduce a pH-responsive nanomedicine approach for 
      activating anti-tumoral macrophages and dendritic cells. Using a layered double 
      hydroxide nanosheet carrier, we co-deliver a T-type calcium channel inhibitor 
      (TTA-Q6) and a CD47 inhibitor (RRX-001) into lung tumors. In the tumor acidic 
      environment, TTA-Q6 is released, disrupting cancer cell calcium uptake, causing 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and inducing calreticulin transfer to the cell 
      surface. Surface calreticulin activates macrophages and triggers dendritic cell 
      maturation, promoting effective antigen presentation and therefore activating 
      antitumor T cells. Simultaneously, RRX-001 reduces CD47 protein levels, aiding in 
      preventing immune escape by calreticulin-rich cancer cells. In lung tumor models 
      in male mice, this combined approach shows anti-tumor effects and immunity 
      against tumor re-exposure, highlighting its potential for lung cancer 
      immunotherapy.

TI  - DLL3-guided therapies in small-cell lung cancer: from antibody-drug conjugate to 
      precision immunotherapy and radioimmunotherapy.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/s12943-024-02012-z [doi]
LID - 97
AB  - DLL3 acts as an inhibitory ligand that downregulates Notch signaling and is 
      upregulated by ASCL1, a transcription factor prevalent in the small-cell lung 
      cancer (SCLC) subtype SCLC-A. Currently, the therapeutic strategies targeting 
      DLL3 are varied, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific T-cell 
      engagers (BiTEs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. Although 
      rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) showed promise in a phase II study, it failed to 
      produce favorable results in subsequent phase III trials, leading to the 
      cessation of its development. Conversely, DLL3-targeted BiTEs have garnered 
      significant clinical interest. Tarlatamab, for instance, demonstrated enhanced 
      response rates and progression-free survival compared to the standard of care in 
      a phase II trial; its biologics license application (BLA) is currently under US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Numerous ongoing phase III studies aim 
      to further evaluate tarlatamab's clinical efficacy, alongside the development of 
      novel DLL3-targeted T-cell engagers, both bispecific and trispecific. CAR-T cell 
      therapies targeting DLL3 have recently emerged and are undergoing various 
      preclinical and early-phase clinical studies. Additionally, preclinical studies 
      have shown promising efficacy for DLL3-targeted radiotherapy, which employs 
      β-particle-emitting therapeutic radioisotopes conjugated to DLL3-targeting 
      antibodies. DLL3-targeted therapies hold substantial potential for SCLC 
      management. Future clinical trials will be crucial for comparing treatment 
      outcomes among various approaches and exploring combination therapies to improve 
      patient survival outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive option for patients with 
      medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can trigger abscopal 
      immune-regulatory effects. However, it remains unclear how cryoablation affects 
      the host-level immune response in NSCLC. In this study, we investigated the local 
      and systemic immunological effects of cryoablation and the potential of combining 
      cryoablation with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade to boost 
      immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: We first investigated systemic 
      immunological effects induced by cryoablation in patients with early-stage NSCLC. 
      Subsequently, we explored cryoablation-induced antitumor immunity and the 
      underlying biological mechanisms using KP (Kras (G12D/+), Tp53 (-/-)) mutant lung 
      cancer cell allograft mouse models. Moreover, the synergistic efficacy of 
      cryoablation and PD-1 blockade was explored in both mouse models and patients 
      with unresectable NSCLC. RESULTS: We found that cryoablation significantly 
      increased circulating CD8(+) T cell subpopulations and proinflammatory cytokines 
      in patients with early-stage NSCLC. In lung cancer cell allograft mouse models, 
      we demonstrated that cryoablation resulted in abscopal growth inhibition of 
      contralateral, non-ablated tumors. Integrated analysis of bulk, single-cell RNA 
      and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data revealed that cryoablation reprogrammed 
      the intratumoral immune microenvironment and increased CD8(+) T cell infiltration 
      with higher effector signature, interferon (IFN) response, and cytolytic 
      activity. Mechanistically, cryoablation promoted antitumor effect through the 
      STING-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, and type I IFN signaling blockade 
      attenuated this antitumor effect. We also found that the combination of PD-1 
      blockade with cryoablation further inhibited tumor growth compared with either 
      treatment alone in an allograft mouse model. Moreover, the combination therapy 
      induced notable tumor suppression and CD8(+) T cell infiltration in patients with 
      unresectable NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide mechanistic insights into 
      how cryoablation triggers the antitumor immune effect in lung cancer, thereby 
      potentiating programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 blockade efficacy in the 
      clinical treatment of NSCLC.

AB  - Brain metastases (BMs) are the most common form of intracranial malignant 
      neoplasms in adults, with a profound impact on quality of life and traditionally 
      associated with a dismal prognosis. Lung cancer accounts for approximately 
      40%-50% of BM across different tumors. The process leading to BMs is complex and 
      includes local invasion, intravasation, tumor cells circulation into the 
      bloodstream, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, extravasation of tumor cells 
      into the brain parenchyma, and interaction with cells of the brain 
      microenvironment, among others. Once the tumor cells have seeded in the brain 
      parenchyma, they encounter different glial cells of the brain, as well as immune 
      cells. The interaction between these cells and tumor cells is complex and is 
      associated with both antitumoral and protumoral effects. To overcome the lethal 
      prognosis associated with BMs, different treatment strategies have been 
      developed, such as immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly 
      inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which have demonstrated to be an effective 
      treatment in both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. These 
      antibodies have shown to be effective in the treatment of BM, alone or in 
      combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, many unsolved questions 
      remain to be answered, such as the sequencing of immunotherapy and radiotherapy, 
      the optimal management in symptomatic BMs, the role of the addition of 
      anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, and so forth. The complexity in the management of BMs in 
      the era of immunotherapy requires a multidisciplinary approach to adequately 
      treat this devastating event. The aim of this review is to summarize evidence 
      regarding epidemiology of BM, its pathophysiology, current approach to treatment 
      strategies, as well as future perspectives.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the highly aggressive malignancies 
      characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis, but treatment options are 
      limited. For SCLC, carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with etoposide 
      chemotherapy has been considered the only standard of care, but the standard 
      first-line treatment only results in 10-month survival. The majority of patients 
      relapse within a few weeks to months after treatment, despite the relatively 
      sensitive response to chemotherapy. Over the past decade, immunotherapy has made 
      significant progress in the treatment of SCLC patients. However, there have been 
      limited improvements in survival rates for SCLC patients with the current immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. In the face of high recurrence 
      rates, small beneficiary populations, and low survival benefits, the exploration 
      of new targets for key molecules and signals in SCLC and the development of drugs 
      with novel mechanisms may provide fresh hope for immunotherapy in SCLC. 
      Therefore, the aim of this review was to explore four new targets, DLL3, TIGIT, 
      LAG-3, and GD2, which may play a role in the immunotherapy of SCLC to find useful 
      clues and strategies to improve the outcome for SCLC patients.

AB  - The organization of immune cells in human tumors is not well understood. 
      Immunogenic tumors harbor spatially localized multicellular 'immunity hubs' 
      defined by expression of the T cell-attracting chemokines CXCL10/CXCL11 and 
      abundant T cells. Here, we examined immunity hubs in human pre-immunotherapy lung 
      cancer specimens and found an association with beneficial response to PD-1 
      blockade. Critically, we discovered the stem-immunity hub, a subtype of immunity 
      hub strongly associated with favorable PD-1-blockade outcome. This hub is 
      distinct from mature tertiary lymphoid structures and is enriched for stem-like 
      TCF7(+)PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells, activated CCR7(+)LAMP3(+) dendritic cells and 
      CCL19(+) fibroblasts as well as chemokines that organize these cells. Within the 
      stem-immunity hub, we find preferential interactions between CXCL10(+) 
      macrophages and TCF7(-)CD8(+) T cells as well as between mature regulatory 
      dendritic cells and TCF7(+)CD4(+) and regulatory T cells. These results provide a 
      picture of the spatial organization of the human intratumoral immune response and 
      its relevance to patient immunotherapy outcomes.

AB  - Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has significantly changed the therapeutic approach for 
      treating patients with surgically resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      Here, peripheral blood inflammation-based biomarkers as well as previously less 
      focused eosinophil fraction, modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), and 
      prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were systematically included to 
      comprehensively analyze their potential in predicting neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
      efficacy and prognosis. We enrolled 189 patients (94 in training and 95 in 
      validation cohorts) with stage I-III B surgically resectable NSCLC treated with 
      neoadjuvant immunotherapy from the National Cancer Center of China. Baseline and 
      post-treatment eosinophils fraction, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
      platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), 
      monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), PNI, mGPS, and their changes were calculated 
      and analyzed for correlation with neoadjuvant immunotherapy efficacy and 
      prognosis. In patients in the major pathological response (MPR) group, the 
      post-treatment eosinophil fraction was significantly high, and NLR, PLR, SII, and 
      MLR were significantly lower compared to the non-MPR group in both the training 
      and validation cohorts. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that 
      post-treatment, eosinophil fraction and SII and their changing were two of the 
      most important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
      showed that post-treatment eosinophil fraction, SII, mGPS, and ΔSII could 
      independently predict MPR in patients treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. 
      Survival analysis showed a significant correlation between high post-treatment 
      NLR, PLR, SII, mGPS, and their changes in ΔNLR and ΔSII elevation with poor 
      overall survival and event-free survival of patients. Our results suggest that 
      inflammatory biomarkers could predict the patient's response to neoadjuvant 
      immunotherapy and prognosis.

AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which has a high rate of metastatic spread 
      and drug resistance, is the most common subtype of lung cancer. Therefore, NSCLC 
      patients have a very poor prognosis and a very low chance of survival. Human 
      cancers are closely linked to regulated cell death (RCD), such as apoptosis, 
      autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Currently, small-molecule 
      compounds targeting various types of RCD have shown potential as anticancer 
      treatments. Moreover, RCD appears to be a specific part of the antitumor immune 
      response; hence, the combination of RCD and immunotherapy might increase the 
      inhibitory effect of therapy on tumor growth. In this review, we summarize 
      small-molecule compounds used for the treatment of NSCLC by focusing on RCD and 
      pharmacological systems. In addition, we describe the current research status of 
      an immunotherapy combined with an RCD-based regimen for NSCLC, providing new 
      ideas for targeting RCD pathways in combination with immunotherapy for patients 
      with NSCLC in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite surgical resection, long-term survival of patients with 
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor. Adjuvant 
      chemotherapy, the standard of care for locally advanced NSCLC, provides a 
      marginal 5.4% benefit in survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown 
      a significant survival benefit in some patients with advanced NSCLC and are being 
      evaluated for perioperative use in resectable NSCLC. METHODS: We conducted a 
      literature search using the PubMed online database to identify clinical trials of 
      immunotherapy in resectable NSCLC and studies analyzing biomarkers and immune 
      priming strategies. RESULTS: Building on previous phase I and II trials, 
      randomized phase III trials have shown efficacy of neoadjuvant nivolumab, 
      perioperative pembrolizumab, adjuvant atezolizumab, and adjuvant pembrolizumab in 
      the treatment of NSCLC with improvement of event-free/disease-free survival of 
      24% to 42%, leading to United States Food and Drug Administration approval of 
      these drugs in the treatment of resectable NSCLC. Three additional phase III 
      trials have also recently reported the use of immunotherapy both before and after 
      surgery, with pathologic complete response rates of 17% to 25%, significantly 
      better than chemotherapy alone. Perioperative ICI therapy has comparable 
      perioperative morbidity to chemotherapy alone and does not impair surgical 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative immunotherapy, in combination with 
      chemotherapy, is safe and improves outcomes in patients with resectable NSCLC. 
      Questions regarding patient selection, the need for adjuvant ICI therapy after 
      neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, and the duration of perioperative immunotherapy 
      remain to be answered by future trials.

TI  - Impact of lymphadenectomy extent on immunotherapy efficacy in postresectional 
      recurred non-small cell lung cancer: a multi-institutional retrospective cohort 
      study.
PG  - 238-252
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymph node (LN) dissection is a common procedure for non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC) to ascertain disease severity and treatment options. However, 
      murine studies have indicated that excising tumor-draining LNs diminished 
      immunotherapy effectiveness, though its applicability to clinical patients 
      remains uncertain. Hence, the authors aim to illustrate the immunological 
      implications of LN dissection by analyzing the impact of dissected LN (DLN) count 
      on immunotherapy efficacy, and to propose a novel 'immunotherapy-driven' LN 
      dissection strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective 
      analysis of NSCLC patients underwent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for recurrence 
      between 2018 and 2020, assessing outcomes based on DLN count stratification. 
      RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were included, of whom 59 had a DLN count less 
      than or equal to 16 (median, IQR: 11, 7-13); 66 had a DLN count greater than 16 
      (median, IQR: 23, 19-29). With a median follow-up time of 14.3 months (95% CI: 
      11.0-17.6), the overall median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 (95% CI: 
      4.1-11.7) months, 11.7 (95% CI: 7.9-15.6) months in the combination therapy 
      subgroup, and 4.8 (95% CI: 3.1-6.4) months in the immunotherapy alone subgroup, 
      respectively. In multivariable Cox analysis, DLN count less than or equal to 16 
      is associated with an improved PFS in all cohorts [primary cohort: HR=0.26 (95% 
      CI: 0.07-0.89), P =0.03]; [validation cohort: HR=0.46 (95% CI: 0.22-0.96), P 
      =0.04]; [entire cohort: HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.32-0.89), P =0.02]. The prognostic 
      benefit of DLN count less than or equal to 16 was more significant in 
      immunotherapy alone, no adjuvant treatment, pN1, female, and squamous carcinoma 
      subgroups. A higher level of CD8+ central memory T cell (Tcm) within LNs was 
      associated with improved PFS (HR: 0.235, 95% CI: 0.065-0.845, P =0.027). 
      CONCLUSIONS: An elevated DLN count (cutoff: 16) was associated with poorer 
      immunotherapy efficacy in recurrent NSCLC, especially pronounced in the 
      immunotherapy alone subgroup. CD8+Tcm proportions in LNs may also impact 
      immunotherapy efficacy. Therefore, for patients planned for adjuvant 
      immunotherapy, a precise rather than expanded lymphadenectomy strategy to 
      preserve immune-depending LNs is recommended.

TI  - Elucidating the Heterogeneity of Immunotherapy Response and Immune-Related 
      Toxicities by Longitudinal ctDNA and Immune Cell Compartment Tracking in Lung 
      Cancer.
PG  - 389-403
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1469 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although immunotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), robust biomarkers of clinical response are lacking. The 
      heterogeneity of clinical responses together with the limited value of 
      radiographic response assessments to timely and accurately predict therapeutic 
      effect-especially in the setting of stable disease-calls for the development of 
      molecularly informed real-time minimally invasive approaches. In addition to 
      capturing tumor regression, liquid biopsies may be informative in capturing 
      immune-related adverse events (irAE). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated 
      longitudinal changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with metastatic 
      NSCLC who received immunotherapy-based regimens. Using ctDNA targeted 
      error-correction sequencing together with matched sequencing of white blood cells 
      and tumor tissue, we tracked serial changes in cell-free tumor load (cfTL) and 
      determined molecular response. Peripheral T-cell repertoire dynamics were 
      serially assessed and evaluated together with plasma protein expression profiles. 
      RESULTS: Molecular response, defined as complete clearance of cfTL, was 
      significantly associated with progression-free (log-rank P = 0.0003) and overall 
      survival (log-rank P = 0.01) and was particularly informative in capturing 
      differential survival outcomes among patients with radiographically stable 
      disease. For patients who developed irAEs, on-treatment peripheral blood T-cell 
      repertoire reshaping, assessed by significant T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypic 
      expansions and regressions, was identified on average 5 months prior to clinical 
      diagnosis of an irAE. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular responses assist with the 
      interpretation of heterogeneous clinical responses, especially for patients with 
      stable disease. Our complementary assessment of the peripheral tumor and immune 
      compartments provides an approach for monitoring of clinical benefits and irAEs 
      during immunotherapy.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Chemo-Immunotherapy for Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e246837
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.6837 [doi]
LID - e246837
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy (ICI-chemotherapy) for patients with 
      early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have reported consistent 
      associations with event-free survival (EFS) and pathologic complete response 
      (pCR) pending longer follow-up for overall survival data. OBJECTIVE: To assess 
      the pooled benefit of ICI-chemotherapy in 2-year EFS and pCR among patients with 
      NSCLC and examine the impact of clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related 
      factors. DATA SOURCES: Full-text articles and abstracts in English were searched 
      in EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through November 1, 2023, and in oncology 
      conference proceedings from January 1, 2008, to November 1, 2023. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Phase 2 or 3 RCTs with neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy with or without 
      adjuvant ICIs vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone with or without placebo or 
      observation in patients with previously untreated NSCLC staged IB to IIIB were 
      included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction of prespecified data 
      elements was performed by 2 reviewers using a structured data abstraction 
      electronic form. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The 
      meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two-year EFS and pCR were 
      the outcomes of interest in patients who received neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy 
      (experimental arm) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm). Aggregated 
      pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes (2-year EFS) and risk 
      ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes (pCR) with their respective 95% CIs were 
      calculated. RESULTS: Eight trials with 3387 patients were included, with some 
      concerns of risk of bias as assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration method, mainly 
      related to outcomes measurements. Neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy was associated 
      with improved 2-year EFS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.66; P < .001) and increased 
      pCR rate (RR, 5.58; 95% CI, 4.27-7.29; P < .001) in the experimental vs control 
      treatment arms. This association was not significantly modified by the main 
      patient characteristics; tumor- or treatment-related factors, including tumor 
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status; type of platinum-compound 
      chemotherapy; number of cycles of neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy; or addition of 
      adjuvant ICIs. Patients whose tumor cells were negative for PD-L1 were at higher 
      risk of relapse (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91) than were those with low (HR, 0.61; 
      95% CI, 0.37-0.71) or high PD-L1 (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27-0.58) (P = .005). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      neoadjuvant ICI-chemotherapy RCTs in patients with early-stage NSCLC, 3 cycles of 
      neoadjuvant platinum-based ICI-chemotherapy were associated with a meaningful 
      improvement in 2-year EFS and pCR.

AB  - Immune checkpoint blockers have transformed non-small-cell lung cancer treatment, 
      but they can lead to autoimmune and inflammatory side effects, leading to the 
      concurrent use of immunosuppressive treatments. In this analysis, we delve into 
      the potential of antibodies checkpoint blockade, focusing on CTLA-4 inhibition 
      using ipilimumab, as a groundbreaking cancer immunotherapy. We also concentrate 
      on the role of biomarkers, particularly PD-L1 activity and mutation significance, 
      in predicting the response to programmed cell death protein 1 blockage and the 
      prevalence of side effects associated with immune-related side effects. In 
      describing the patterns of cancer response to immunotherapy, we underline the 
      limitations of response assessment criteria like RECIST and World Health 
      Organization. We also stress the necessity of ongoing studies and clinical 
      trials, standardized guidelines, and additional research to improve response 
      assessment in the era of immunotherapy.

AB  - Lung cancer (LC) and tuberculosis (TB) are two major global public health 
      problems, and the incidence of LC-TB is currently on the rise. Therefore 
      effective clinical interventions are crucial for LC-TB. The aim of this review is 
      to provide up-to-date information on the immunological profile and therapeutic 
      biomarkers in patients with LC-TB. We discuss the immune mechanisms involved, 
      including the immune checkpoints that play an important role in the treatment of 
      patients with LC-TB. In addition, we explore the susceptibility of patients with 
      LC to TB and summarise the latest research on LC-TB. Finally, we discuss future 
      prospects in this field, including the identification of potential targets for 
      immune intervention. In conclusion, this review provides important insights into 
      the complex relationship between LC and TB and highlights new advances in the 
      detection and treatment of both diseases.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors( ICI) became available in the field of non-small 
      cell lung cancer in 2015. Nine years have already passed since their use in 
      clinical practice, and ICI are now being developed for clinical application not 
      only in un-resectable advanced stage lung cancer but also in peri-operative 
      treatment. In this report, we review the history of immunotherapy and summarize 
      the current status of clinical development of ICI in advanced lung cancer and its 
      use as peri-operative treatment. The biomarkers analysis and management of 
      immune-related adverse events, which are important in the treatment of ICI, will 
      also be discussed in this review.

      Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 517-528

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 
      neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in treating 
      patients with NSCLC were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases, 
      eligible studies, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, guidelines, and 
      conference abstracts. The meta-analysis was performed by the Stata/SE 12.0 
      software. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were eventually included. 
      The results of the meta-analysis showed that neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy 
      significantly improved the objective response rate compared with neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy (CT; 62.46% vs 41.88%, P = 0.003), but the objective response rate 
      of neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy was roughly comparable to that of neoadjuvant 
      single-immunotherapy (15.74% vs 10.45%, P = 0.387). Major pathologic response 
      (MPR) rate and pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant 
      immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy were significantly 
      superior to neoadjuvant CT alone and neoadjuvant single-immunotherapy, 
      respectively. Compared with neoadjuvant CT alone, neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy 
      increased the down-staging rate (40.16% vs 26.70%, P = 0.060), the surgical 
      resection rate (83.69% vs 73.07%, P = 0.231), and R0 resection rate (86.19% vs 
      77.98%, P = 0.502), but there were no statistically significant differences. 
      Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy did not increase the postoperative complications 
      rate than neoadjuvant CT alone (40.20% vs 41.30%, P = 0.920). In terms of safety, 
      neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant double-immunotherapy did not 
      increase the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and the grade 
      3 or higher TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy had 
      better clinical efficacy than neoadjuvant CT for patients with NSCLC. MPR rate 
      and pCR rate of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy and neoadjuvant 
      double-immunotherapy were significantly superior to neoadjuvant CT and 
      neoadjuvant single-immunotherapy, respectively, for patients with NSCLC, showing 
      that MPR rate and pCR rate were probably considered as alternative endpoints for 
      survival benefit. TRAEs were comparable between the corresponding groups. The 
      long-term survival outcome of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC 
      needs to be further confirmed to better guide clinical practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy (IO) has established a new milestone in lung cancer 
      treatment. Several registrational studies have approved immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors (ICIs) in different settings, including the metastatic nonsmall cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC). As well known, responders are just a certain proportion of 
      patients; therefore, their selection by using predictive factors has stood out as 
      a crucial issue to address in tailoring a patient-centered care. AREAS COVERED: 
      In our review we propose a detailed yet handy cross section on ICIs as first-line 
      treatment in metastatic NSCLC, regarding indications, histological, clinical, and 
      blood-based biomarkers, other than their mechanisms of resistance and new 
      immunological actionable targets. We performed a literature search through PubMed 
      entering keywords complying with crucial features of immunotherapy. EXPERT 
      OPINION: IO represents the backbone of lung cancer treatment. Trials are 
      currently testing novel immune blockade agents assessing combinatorial approaches 
      with standard ICIs, or antibody drug conjugates (ADC), harboring immunological 
      targets. Perfecting patients' selection is an ongoing challenge and a more and 
      more urgent need in order to best predict responders who will consistently 
      benefit from it.

TI  - Tumor-Tailored Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Facilitate IL-12 Circular RNA 
      Delivery for Enhanced Lung Cancer Immunotherapy.
PG  - e2400307
LID - 10.1002/adma.202400307 [doi]
AB  - The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) -based immunotherapies for cancer is highly 
      dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable 
      lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies 
      is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk 
      of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further 
      complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the 
      potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high-throughput 
      combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently 
      deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3, 
      demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung 
      cancer cells over ALC-0315, the industry-standard LNPs, while providing potent 
      immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with 
      circRNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12), induces a robust immune response in a 
      Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological 
      profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45(+) leukocytes 
      and enhances infiltration of CD8(+) T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3 
      LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight 
      the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer 
      therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics.
